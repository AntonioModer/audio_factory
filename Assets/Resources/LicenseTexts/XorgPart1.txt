The following is the 'standard copyright' agreed upon by most contributors,
and is currently the canonical license preferred by the X.Org Foundation.
This is a slight variant of the common MIT license form published by the
Open Source Initiative at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

Copyright holders of new code should use this license statement where
possible, and insert their name to this list.  Please sort by surname
for people, and by the full name for other entities (e.g.  Juliusz
Chroboczek sorts before Intel Corporation sorts before Daniel Stone).
